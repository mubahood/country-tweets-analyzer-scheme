## Project: Tweet Analysis Library using Scheme

### Author
**Muhindo Mubaraka**

### Introduction
Social media platforms, like Twitter, have become crucial sources of data for researchers and analysts to understand trends, track sentiment, and monitor public opinions. Analyzing tweets can provide insights into how people react to events, political situations, or social issues. This project aims to develop a Scheme-based library to analyze tweets about a given country from the last 12 months. It can fetch tweets from the Twitter API or a local JSON file. By implementing essential analysis functionalities, such as sentiment analysis, it provides a tool for developers interested in extracting meaningful insights from Twitter data.

### Motivation
With the increasing usage of social media, platforms like Twitter generate vast amounts of data. Analyzing this data can achieve several important tasks:
1. **Public Sentiment Monitoring**: Understand how people feel about political events, social movements, or public figures.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Analyze the occurrences of hashtags, keywords, or topics to comprehend trends.
3. **Geographical Insights**: Study regional differences in public opinions and reactions.

This project will build a functional Scheme library to support analysts in easily collecting, cleaning, and analyzing tweets, focusing on past tweets from a given country.

### Main Packages Used and Their Roles
This section outlines the key packages used in the project, their functionalities, and how they contribute to the system:
1. **overeasy**
    - **Role**: Simplifies JSON data parsing and handling in Scheme.
    - **Usage**: Parses tweet data from JSON files efficiently, enabling seamless extraction and processing of tweet text and metadata.
2. **mcfly**
    - **Role**: Provides utilities for working with APIs and managing HTTP requests.
    - **Usage**: Essential for interfacing with the Twitter API, sending requests for tweets, and handling the responses.
3. **data-science-master**
    - **Role**: A comprehensive library for implementing data science operations in Scheme.
    - **Usage**: Utilized for data processing tasks, including cleaning, transformation, and basic statistical operations on the tweet data.
4. **http-client**
    - **Role**: Facilitates HTTP/HTTPS communication within Scheme applications.
    - **Usage**: Handles the HTTP GET and POST requests required for fetching tweet data directly from the Twitter API.
5. **html-parsing**
    - **Role**: Parses and processes HTML content.
    - **Usage**: Used when extracting additional tweet details from web pages or embedded content containing metadata.
6. **gregor**
    - **Role**: Provides date and time manipulation utilities.
    - **Usage**: Filters tweets based on their timestamp, ensuring only tweets from the past 12 months are included in the analysis.

### Key Code and Explanations
1. **Fetching Tweet Data**
    ```scheme
    (define (fetch-tweets-from-json file-name)
      (define tweet-data (read-json file-name))
      (map extract-tweet-text tweet-data))
    ```
    - **Explanation**: `fetch-tweets-from-json` reads tweet data from a JSON file using `read-json` and maps the `extract-tweet-text` function over the data to extract the tweet text.

2. **Cleaning Tweet Data**
    ```scheme
    (define (clean-tweet tweet)
      (define clean-text (string-replace tweet "[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]" ""))
      clean-text)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: `clean-tweet` cleans the text of special characters using `string-replace`, leaving only alphanumeric characters and spaces.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
    ```scheme
    (define (analyze-sentiment tweet)
      (define positive-words '("good" "happy" "great" "love" "excellent"))
      (define negative-words '("bad" "sad" "angry" "hate" "poor"))
      (define sentiment (if (any (lambda (word) (string-contains? tweet word)) positive-words)
                                    'positive
                                    (if (any (lambda (word) (string-contains? tweet word)) negative-words)
                                         'negative
                                         'neutral)))
      sentiment)
    ```
    - **Explanation**: `analyze-sentiment` uses predefined lists of positive and negative words to classify the sentiment of a tweet as positive, negative, or neutral.

### Testing and Results
The system was tested using two datasets:
1. **Real-time data from Twitter**: Tweets were collected based on specific keywords such as "Uganda" or "Kenya."
2. **Archived data from a JSON file**: A sample file containing tweets from the last 12 months was used for testing.

After collecting and cleaning the data, sentiment analysis was performed. The system successfully classified the sentiment of the tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates how tweet data can be analyzed using a Scheme-based library. By implementing functions to fetch data, clean it, and perform sentiment analysis, the project provides a starting point for more sophisticated analyses. As social media data continues to grow, such tools will become increasingly valuable in understanding public opinion and trends.
